# Group4WordGame
Creating a text based game for the first group project of the year!!
The game is based on a 2d array which the player is tasked with escaping.
You begin the game waking up in a bedroom to the sound of a crackling radio talking of the apocalypse that has ruined cardiff.
You must navigate through the maze encountering zombies to collect items and escape the city without dying in battle.
Throughout the journey you will move through a number of unique locations some of which hold items and some of which give you the opportunity to escape without having to venture to the edge of the city.
How to play:


GO <direction>

CONSUME <item_id>

TAKE <item_id> [amount]

DROP <item_id> [amount]


FIGHT (to start a battle)

ATTACK <enemy number> <weapon_id>
